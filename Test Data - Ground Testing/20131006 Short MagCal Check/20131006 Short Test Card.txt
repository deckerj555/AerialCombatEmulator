Execution:
Power ON: 2:13:50
DOP < 6000 @ 22:08:08
90 deg pitch up at 22:19:00 local - caused DOP to jump to 30,000
DOP in the 14,000s at 22:20:00, MagCal on time at 22:20:00
Rotation CCW complete 22:21:10 - again just touching it for the rotation caused DOP to spike.
Missed 22:22:00 mark.  Waiting for next whole minute.
22:23:00 rotation 360 Clockwise on time. (roughly 15-20 seconds for full rotation)
22:24:00 rotation 180 CCW on time (roughtly 7 second rotation)
22:25:00 missed.  waiting for next whole minute
22:26:05 return to original shooting line.
22:28:00 Rotate approx 20 deg CW
22:28:30 MagCal on line.  Not confirmed in putty.  too fast.
