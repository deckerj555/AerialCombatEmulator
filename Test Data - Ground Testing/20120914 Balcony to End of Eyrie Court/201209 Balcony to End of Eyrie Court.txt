Test Setup:
- rev132 on both, with minor mods to log DLCs
- DF001 on the Acura dashboard 
- DF002 on the balcony rail of Jeff's master bedroom

Test Objective:
Gather more data that has a GPS distance much greater than the GPS uncertainties.

Results:
Haven't looks at the data at all yet.

Conculsions:
Initial look indicates GPS uncertainties (or at least the GPS coordinate "bounce") is responisble for the poor killshot performance at the Mormon Church.

Chronology:
- DF002 has been having trouble get a GPS soluntion; this the third time I've wanted to test and DF002's GPS module has required an excessive amount to time to get a solution.  DF002 was outside on the handrail for quite a while (~15min) before getting solution (actual time in logs) powered by D-cell pack.  
- DF001 was put on the dash of the Acura (switch forward, USB and FTDI aft) and driven to the end of Eyrie.
- Turned around so the car (and thus the DF) was pointed at the house
- phsycially aimed the DF001 at DF002 (no killshot registered)
- DF001 rotated in yaw 90deg CCW, then straight ahead (at DF002), then 90 CW
- repeated: 90deg CCW, 0deg, 90 CW
- magCal
- moved the car for traffic leaving Eyrie Court
- played with DF orientation trying to get a killshot; no joy
- magCal
- played with DF orientation trying to get a killshot; still no joy
- magCal for the 3rd time--still no killshot
- drive back to garage
- sat in garage for a few minutes, amazed the GPS module still had a solution
