

Test Setup:
- rev139 on both
- setup DF's outside of car's if possible.
- logging cards wipped prior to test

 
Test Steps:
[ ] identify line of sight locations, as far apart as reasonable on bingen point.
	DF002 Location: Sitting on curb, outside NB, pointing away from NB building.
	DF001 Location: 
[x] Setup DF002
	[x] Photograph
		- nope... but it's setup on the curb, outside NB
	[x] point to Iphone magnetic North
		- nope... but iphone is super shitty... but it's lined up with the curb
	[x] Power on
		- Time ~20:40 local
	[ ] connect in Putty and monitor
		- Didn't bother with this - 
	- GPS Solution ~21:10
[ ] Setup DF001
	[x] Photograph
	[x] point to Iphone magnetic North
		- nope, aligned right at DF002
	[ ] Power on
		~21:35
		- power cycled 1 time because no lights came on.
		- power cycled a second time... still no luck
			-symptoms: - power light comes on... nothing else happens
		- re-deployed code and everything seemed normal
		- power cycled and device on and funcitoning ~21:39
	[x] connect in Putty and monitor
[ ] Verify radio connection
	[ ] If no connection, move DF002 to new location with radio connection (leave powered on throughout this move)
	- Had no radio connection sitting on the ground in front of water tower.
		- picked up 3 feet, and acquired signal...
		- DOP and Time zero'ed out... meaning attnav is stale
		-** Moving to hood of car for continued testing.
		- Powering off, moving to car, and powering on.
		- Powering back on (sitting on trunk, pointed at DF002) at ~21:47
		- Only have link with other DF, when Jeff is holding the antenna with his fingers.
		
[x] Point DF001 towards DF002
[x] Mag Cal (button 7 times)
	- Mag cal at  	TSA 3.3678 (last digit floating) - ~21:58
[x] maintain heading towards DF001 after Mag Cal for 1 minute
[x] rotate DF002 360deg CW (right turn), returning to original position of mag cal
	- Right turn ~22:01
[x] rotate DF002 360deg CCW (left turn), returing to original position of mag cal
	- Left turn ~22:04
[x] Moving by hand off trunk, holding as directly at NB as visually possible
	- this is the third 360 turn.  it will be CW, and stop off the car, and pointed towards NB ~20:08 (translation and roation happening bitches)
	- AFter moving to grass position, yaw showed ~2000mrad.  Then at ~22:10 we rotated CCW back onto the car trunk... and we be killin motherfuckers
[x] rotate (while still on trunk) DF001 90deg off target alignment, and Mag cal (button 7 times)
	- rotating CW, aligning with watertower road (pointing westish) ~22:12 magcal
	- after mag cal (which we saw in putty) we didn't kill anyone.  possible pitch/yaw coupled rotation issue (because it initiallized not at level)
	- ~22:14 - pitching down, while 90 Right of target to try and kill - and booya, killin a mother fucker., pitching down until reporting 67mrad (vs when sitting on binder reporting 167mrad)
[x] drive back from watertower to northbay
[x] power down at ~1028
