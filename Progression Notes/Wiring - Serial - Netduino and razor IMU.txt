default baud is 9600

Netduino
COM1 is pin0 = Rx, and pin1 = Tx
COM2 is pin2 = Rx, and pin3 = Tx

Jeff's FTDI Serial cable wire color convention:
Tx = Orange
Rx = Yellow


Forward
Go through the SerialPortHelper class and understand byte[] information.
Access the second Netduino Serial Port
parse the stream... that could take a while
pick a piece of the stream, do math on it, and write it out the second serial port to the terminal.
don't fuck it up, or take too long to do all that.
