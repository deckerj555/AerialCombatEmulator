Examples of States as of March 20, 2012
When the device is powered on, it will cycle through all Led's, then turn them all off.
Imediately following this, the Led's will be representative of the above assignments.
imuLed will BlinkyBlink 1-3 times which might lead the user to believe the device is pointing north.  However, this is because the imu outputs a 0 yaw angle while initializing.
Once operating, here are some of the trickier states the device might be in and the Led outputs that coorelate:

Had good gps solution, operating normally, imuLed not North&Level, then razorVenus Tx wire unplugged:
killLed - slow blink
deadLed - NotImplemented
gpsLed	- blinkyblink
imuLed	- Off;

In the same situation, if the device was pointing north&level when the tx line was unplugged, the imuLed would continue to blinkyblink.  This is because when stale data is detected, to preserve logging ability, the entire attnav is preserved as last recieved, except positionDOP and gpsTimeInWeek.
